# Xbox Controller Showcase 🎮

This is a clean, responsive showcase page built using just **HTML and CSS** — no frameworks, libraries, or build tools. I created this project as a personal challenge to prove to myself that I have a strong grasp of front-end fundamentals and can build a polished, modern site from scratch without relying on external tools or components.

## 💡 Purpose

This wasn't built for a client or assignment — it was built for **me**.

After months of studying and building smaller pieces, I wanted to create something that:
- Demonstrates my comfort with layout, positioning, and responsive design
- Uses pure HTML/CSS to handle structure, styling, and responsiveness
- Serves as a confidence checkpoint to validate my growth as a developer

## 🧰 Tools Used

- HTML5
- CSS

## 🖼️ Images & Branding

> **Disclaimer:** I do **not** own any of the images or logos used in this project. All visual assets related to Xbox and the Xbox controller are the property of their respective owners. These were used purely for educational and non-commercial purposes to enhance the visual design while I learned layout and styling.
